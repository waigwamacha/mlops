### Homework 3 details

- The goal of this homework is to train a simple model for predicting the duration of a ride, but use Mage for it.
- The mage files were too huge to push to github, so the python code used for each section is provided instead:

1. Ingestion code block: ```ingest.py```
2. prepare data using a transformer code block in Mage: ```prepare_data.py```
3. Train a linear regression model: ```train_model.py```
4. Log trained model and register it in mlflow: ```register_model.py```
5. The above 4 scripts can be found all combined in one python file: ```homework3.py```
